<p>Throughout 2019, as I finished up my dissertation in manufacturing engineering <!--TODO -- link to dissertation-->, I had been immersed in ideas around connection. In my research, I worked with a metric that represented all the energy that had gone into making a part, product, or other manufactured good, all the way back to Earth-based processes (emergy). A really good example of this is the production of gasoline. It starts as oil, which is billion year-old plants. Those plants were originally produced from the sun, water, and hydrogen, each a form of energy. To the energy in these forms, you add the energy used to extract the oil, which includes the direct energy (usually from generators, so more gasoline) used to run the drills & pumps, but also the energy embodied in the drills and pumps themselves, as well as the energy supporting the lives of the operators running the drills. As you start to see, it is an extensive web, with energy all the way down.</p>

<p>When growing up in the 1980s, I had pen-pals, which included a distant cousin, some European-based folks and a few other friends. Additionally, my grandparents were snowbirds, and would drive every winter from their home in New England to warmer climes in the South and Southwest, sending me postcards so I could track their progress. In college during the dot-com era, I wrote to my friends from school over summer break when we were each back home, doing internships or other activities. </p>

<p>As 2019 drew to a close, I wanted to experiment with ideas of slow connection, accessing again the fun of developing a relationship slowly and with remove, but also with the thoughtful focus of an hour or two with only a pen, paper, and the letter I was responding to in front of me. Well, those items and a cup of coffee.</p>
